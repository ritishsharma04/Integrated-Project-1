        <h1 class="display-6 mb-4">HTML &amp; HTML5 Questions</h1>
        <p class="mb-4">An unavoidable and most-asked question is the one below:</p>
        
        <h2 class="h4 text-primary mb-2">1. What is HTML?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Ans. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is also the most popular markup language for creating websites that can be viewed in a web browser.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h4 text-primary mb-2">2. What is the difference between HTML elements and tags?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Ans. HTML elements communicate to the browser how to render text. When surrounded by angular brackets &lt; &gt; they form HTML tags, which contain and surround the text.</p>
        
        <p class="text-primary mb-4">The next set of questions is a few generic HTML questions with answers that you should know before going into an interview.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h4 text-primary mb-2">3. What does DOCTYPE mean?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Ans. The term DOCTYPE means Document Type Definition and tells the browser which type of HTML is used on a webpage. Browsers use DOCTYPE to determine how to render a page. Moreover, failing to use DOCTYPE will load your page in Quirks Mode.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h4 text-primary mb-2">4. What are the limitations when serving XHTML pages?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Ans. The main limitation is the poor browser support of XHTML. Internet Explorer and other user agents cannot parse XHTML as XML. Thus, it is not as extensible language as one might think.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h4 text-primary text-primary mb-2"></h2>
        
        <h2 class="h4 text-primary mb-2">5. What is the syntax difference between a bulleted list and numbered list?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Ans. Bulleted lists use the &lt;ul&gt; tag, which stands for "unordered", whereas &lt;ol&gt; is used to create an ordered list.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h4 text-primary mb-2">6. What is the difference between a div and a frame?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Ans. A &lt;div&gt; is a container element for grouping and styling, whereas a &lt;frame&gt; creates divisions within a web page and should be used when the information is static. The use of &lt;frameset&gt; and &lt;frames&gt; are no longer popular and are now being replaced with the more flexible &lt;iframe&gt;, which has become popular for embedding elements from other websites (i.e. Youtube videos) into a page.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h4 text-primary mb-2">7. What is the difference between the application model of HTML and HTML5?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Ans. There is no big difference between the two. HTML5 is a continuation of HTML. There has been no major paradigm shift. From a broader viewpoint, HTML was a simple language for laying out text and images on a webpage. HTML5, on the other hand, was developed as a development platform that can build rich web apps and more, including mobile apps. HTML5 also has a new set of interactive graphics. And, it has several new elements, supports offline data storage for applications, and has more robust exchange protocols.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h4 text-primary mb-2">8. What are some new HTML5 markup elements?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Ans. Among several new elements, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;datalist&gt;, &lt;command&gt;, &lt;details&gt;, &lt;figure&gt;, &lt;figcaption&gt;, &lt;summary&gt;, &lt;mark&gt;, &lt;meter&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;progress&gt;, &lt;ruby&gt;, &lt;rt&gt;, &lt;rp&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;time&gt;, and &lt;wbr&gt; are some of the new elements.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h4 text-primary mb-2">9. What are the new image elements in HTML5?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Ans. The new image elements in HTML5 are Canvas and WebGL. &lt;canvas&gt; is a new element that acts as a container for graphical elements like images and graphics. WebGL stands for Web Graphics Language, a free and open standard for generating interactive 3D graphics in a web browser.</p>

            
        <h2 class="h4 text-primary mb-2">10. What are some of the major new APIs that come standard with HTML5?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Ans. Among others are Media API, Text Track API, Application Cache API, User Interaction, Data Transfer API, Command API, and the History API.</p>
            
        <h2 class="h4 text-primary mb-2">11. What is the difference in caching between HTML5 and the old version of HTML?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Ans. A crucial new feature of HTML5 is the Application Cache which creates an offline version of a web application, and stores website files such as HTML files, CSS, images, and JavaScript, locally. Obviously, that speeds up site performance.</p>
            
        <h2 class="h4 text-primary mb-2">12. What is an image map?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Ans. An image map is a list of coordinates relating to a specific image, created to hyperlink areas of the image to different destinations (as opposed to a normal image link, in which the entire area of the image links to a single destination).</p>
            
        <h2 class="h4 text-primary mb-2">13. What is the advantage of collapsing white space?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Ans. White spaces are blank sequences of space characters, which are actually treated as a single space character in HTML. The browser collapses multiple spaces into a single space, so we can indent lines of text without worrying about multiple spaces. This enables us to organize the code into a much more readable format.</p>
